Study region
The Oum Er Rbia watershed, Morocco, is a region facing severe water stress conditions associated with the simultaneous occurrence of meteorological and hydrological droughts.
Study focus
This study proposes a new hydrometeorological drought composite index (HDCI) by adapting an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach for synergistic integration of multisource drought-related indicators. The streamflow anomalies, hydroclimatic coefficients and water variations in dams were comparatively explored as response variables for the selection and weighting of the HDCI components using Shapley additive explanations theory (SHAP).
New hydrological insights for the region
The severity of hydrometeorological drought in Oum Er Rbia watershed is regulated by the interaction of several factors, among which the contribution of terrestrial water storage to hydrometeorological drought related to streamflow anomalies tends to become more pronounced as the number of influencing factors decreases. The new composite index is highly correlated with the reference hydrometric variables. However, heteroscedasticity between hydrometric stations influences the performance of the HDCI. Therefore, the integration of factors based on spatial dependencies represents a potential avenue for reducing the influence of spatial heterogeneities. Overall, by integrating exclusively geospatial and reanalysis data, HDCI has advantages for the assessment of hydrometeorological drought conditions at the pixel scale compared with conventional methods, which use direct measurements of hydrometric variables but are often discontinuous and unavailable in real time.

Afforestation is of international interest for its positive benefits on carbon storage, ecology, and society, but its impacts on terrestrial and atmospheric processes are still poorly understood. This study presents the first use of a coupled land surface and convection permitting atmospheric model (CPM) to quantify hydrometeorological effects of afforestation across the United Kingdom, focusing on atmospheric processes often missing in hydrological models. Generating a scenario of 93 000 km 2 (40%) additional woodland across the UK, the periods of 2042–2052 and 2062–2072 are analysed. Simulated afforestation alters seasonal and regional UK hydrometeorology. Countrywide runoff increases in all seasons (between 5.4–11 mm and 4.3–8.6% per season) due to elevated subsurface flows from greater soil moisture. Evaporation decreases in summer (− 20.6 mm,− 10%) but increases in winter (8.1 mm, 15%) whereas rainfall increases throughout all seasons (between 2.2–6.86 mm and 0.9%–2.2% per season). Greater winter rainfall is detected along Great Britain's west coastline as increased surface roughness produces prolonged and heavier rainfall. In the summer, lower albedo increases potential evapotranspiration and reduces near surface specific humidity: water is locked in deeper soil layers as transpiration diminishes and the topsoil dries out. However, the magnitude of hydrometeorological change due to altered land cover is smaller than the uncertainty in local climate change projections. This work sets a precedent in illustrating the impacts of afforestation on hydrology using a high-resolution CPM and highlights the importance of coupled hydrometeorological processes when investigating land cover impacts on hydrological processes.
